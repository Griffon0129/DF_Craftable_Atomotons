if your going for the Orzammar challenge from the Dwarf Fortress wiki and want to add Paragon nobles to the game: http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Playstyle_challenge#Orzammar
I added this pointless position, they require and demand exactly the same as the Barons but function like the Champions (just so they have some responsibility).
