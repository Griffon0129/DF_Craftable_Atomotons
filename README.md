# DF_Craftable_Atomotons
From the Dwarf Fortress: (http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Playstyle_challenge#Dwemer_City-State) where it says "Modding bonus: Add craftable allied automatons." that is what I am trying to acomplish here.




Currently untested but wanted to upload here to save my work.
