# DF_Craftable_Atomotons
From the Dwarf Fortress: (http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Playstyle_challenge#Dwemer_City-State) where it says "Modding bonus: Add craftable allied automatons." that is what I am trying to acomplish here.




Created with raws from v.44.09




After testing I found that when they do the custom reaction it places the spiders in the craftdwarves workshop.
They were named "Tame Atmoton Spider."
I destroyed the workshop which released all the spiders.
They all started spreading out and moving around, but eventually started dissapearing without leaving corpses.
Also, they did not exist anywhere in the unit list, so I don't know what is going on with them.
